*************************
* Notice: the command lines are case insensitive 
* but the user name, group name, service host name, 
* gateway host name and the comments 
* will be stored and used on the gateway with case information.

# Key point
# NAT can be applied every where, but security gateway cannot. 
# We need to make sure that all the devices attached to the network behind this security gateway are known!
# This is possible, but it is not 

# Future
# 0. Acl virtualization: application level on network (between gateways) 
# 1. Firewall implementation: zones supporting
# 2. Firewall virtualization: multiple virtual instances supporting
# 3. Network Virtualization: convert SSH forwarding into a kind of VPN
